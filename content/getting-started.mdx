Tidy UI presents a collection of lightweight, modularized, and opinionated React components.
These components adhere to a consistent design and theme, meaning you won't have to worry much about styling them.

At the heart of Tidy UI is [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), which forms the foundation of the entire logic.
The coherence of styling and design system is achieved through the utilization of the
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library. These two frameworks together form the core of Tidy UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into Tidy UI, ensure that you include the following dependencies in your React application:

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (v18 or later)
- [Styled components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) (v5.3.3 or later)

## Installation

To use Tidy UI, you have a couple of options to choose from:

### All-in-One

If you want every single component from the entire Tidy UI collection, just install the
[@tidy-ui/all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tidy-ui/all) package.
This is the easiest approach to start with and it's also simple to manage. However, if you're concerned about
your **node_modules** folder becoming too big, the next installation method might suit you better.

```shell
npm i @tidy-ui/all
```

### Pick and Choose

Alternatively, you can decide to install [individual packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40tidy-ui) as per
your project's requirements. But keep in mind,
you must include the essential [@tidy-ui/commons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tidy-ui/commons) package,
which provides the basic building blocks for all other Tidy UI packages.
This way, you'll only be adding the necessary packages, and only when you need them.
If you're concerned about keeping your **node_modules** size in check, this is the optimal choice.
However, as your project's dependency count grows, keeping track of version compatibility might become challenging.

```shell
npm i @tidy-ui/commons @tidy-ui/...
```

## Usage

Once you've installed Tidy UI's dependencies, follow these steps to set up your app's root using a custom provider
exported by Tidy UI. Depending on your project's needs, you can choose from these different ways of using Tidy UI:

### Basic Setup

At the very least, you need to configure your app's root with the **TidyUiProvider** and a chosen [[theme]].

<Note>
  If you want to offer multi-theme support to your app, you'll need to manage the logic for theme switching on your own.
  This way, users can switch to whatever theme suits them best.
</Note>

```js
// 1. Import the custom provider and a theme of your choice
import { orchidLight, TidyUiProvider } from '@tidy-ui/commons';

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap TidyUiProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <TidyUiProvider theme={orchidLight}>
      <RestOfYourApp />
    </TidyUiProvider>
  );
}
```

### Adding Extra CSS Goodness

<Chip>recommended</Chip>

To bring some CSS best practices to your app, include the following components along with the TidyUiProvider:

- **GlobalResetStyle**: This takes care of inconsistencies that can arise across various browsers.
  Each browser has default rules applied to all pages before loading files. These browser-specific styles persist unless
  you override them explicitly. Adding this component will reset all these browser-specific styles.

- **GlobalDefaultStyle**: This component brings standardization to potential HTML elements. It adds default
  CSS to specific HTML elements, which serves as a fallback in case no configuration is provided by any Tidy UI components.

```js
// 1. Import the custom provider and a theme of your choice, along with reset and default styles
import { GlobalDefaultStyle, GlobalResetStyle, orchidLight, TidyUiProvider } from '@tidy-ui/commons';

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap TidyUiProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalResetStyle />
      <TidyUiProvider theme={orchidLight}>
        <GlobalDefaultStyle />
        <RestOfYourApp />
      </TidyUiProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Importing a Custom Font

You can also opt to include a custom font of your choice in your app using the **GlobalFont** component.
Just provide the [[family]] and [[url]] attributes, and the font will be loaded into your app.

```js
// 1. Import the custom provider and a theme of your choice, along with reset and default styles and font
import { GlobalDefaultStyle, GlobalResetStyle, GlobalFont, orchidLight, TidyUiProvider } from '@tidy-ui/commons';

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap TidyUiProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalResetStyle />
      <GlobalFont family="'Open Sans', sans-serif" url="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans" />
      <TidyUiProvider theme={orchidLight}>
        <GlobalDefaultStyle />
        <RestOfYourApp />
      </TidyUiProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```
