## Key Features

### Encapsulation

The Border component acts as a virtual hug, encapsulating individual components or groups to create visually
appealing structures within your user interface. Simply wrap your component with the **Border** tag to
utilize this feature.

```jsx
<Border>
  <Text.H5>The Great Wall of China</Text.H5>
  <Text.Base>
    One of the most iconic and awe-inspiring structures on Earth, the Great Wall of China spans approximately 13,171
    miles (21,196 kilometers). Contrary to popular belief, it is not a single continuous wall but a collection of walls
    and fortifications built over centuries by various Chinese dynasties. Its main purpose was to protect against
    invasions by nomadic tribes from the north. This incredible feat of engineering showcases the determination and
    ingenuity of ancient Chinese civilization. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of China's
    rich history and culture.
