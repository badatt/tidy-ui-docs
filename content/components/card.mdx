## Card Component Documentation

The **Card** component is a versatile tool that empowers you to create visually appealing and organized layouts on your web pages. It offers a range of components designed to enhance the presentation and organization of your content. With its user-friendly features, the Card component is perfect for a variety of scenarios, from showcasing product details to displaying articles and more.

### Overview

The Card component brings a touch of elegance to your web design by encapsulating information within distinct containers. It primarily exports four underlying components: `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, and `CardFooter`. Each of these components serves a unique purpose, contributing to the overall structure and visual appeal of the card layout.

### Key Components

1. **Card:** The heart of the Card component, this primary element allows you to wrap and highlight essential information. You have the freedom to choose from various accents that provide users with insights into the nature of the enclosed content. You can even select the edge of the Card where the accent should be displayed. Whether you're presenting articles, products, or any other content, the Card component ensures a seamless and visually pleasing layout.

2. **CardHeader:** This component is perfect for titles and headings that introduce the card's content. It offers the added feature of linking the card to external sources by providing hyperlinks that open in new tabs. You can also choose to visually separate the header from the body using a divider.

3. **CardBody:** The CardBody component is designed to contain the main content of the card. Whether you're displaying images, text, or media, the CardBody ensures a clean and organized presentation that captures users' attention.

4. **CardFooter:** Use the CardFooter to add footer content, such as additional information and action buttons. This component is particularly useful for displaying supplementary details and allowing users to interact with the card. Similar to the CardHeader, you have the option to separate the footer from the body using a divider.

### Customization and Theming

The Card component provides a range of customization options to align with your design preferences. Each card comes with rounded edges by default, creating a visually pleasing look and feel. For a more distinct appearance, you can opt for sharp edges, adding a touch of modernity to your design.

All components within the Card family are powered by theming and styling, allowing you to seamlessly integrate them into your application's overall visual scheme. You can easily adapt the Card's appearance to match your branding and design standards, ensuring a consistent and polished user experience.

### Example Usage

import { Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter } from './Card';

const ArticleCard = () => {
  return (
    <Card accent="info" accentPosition="top" href="article-link">
      <CardHeader>Breaking News</CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter>
        <button>Read More</button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
};
