## Key Features

### Qualify Any Component

Imagine adding a touch of distinction to your products, notifications, or user statuses. Simply wrap any component
with the **Badge** element and harness the [[content]] attribute to infuse it with enriched meaning.

```jsx
<Stack gap="2rem">
  <Badge content={9}>
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Email />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={9}>
    <Text.body1>Mails</Text.body1>
  </Badge>
</Stack>
```

### Various Tones

Unify your app's aesthetics seamlessly with Badge customization. Explore a spectrum of [[tone]] options,
allowing you to align Badge appearance with your color palette and branding.

```jsx
<Stack gap="2rem">
  <Badge content={10} tone="major">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Add />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="minor">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.AddCircle />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="neutral">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.CalendarMonth />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="info">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Info />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="success">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Success />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="warning">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Warning />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="danger">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Dangerous />} />
  </Badge>
</Stack>
```

### Content or Dot

Refine precision by placing content or an understated dot in the top-right corner of your component.
Employ the [[isDotted]] attribute to effortlessly draw attention to the details that matter.

```jsx
<Badge isDotted tone="danger">
  <Icon ele={<Icon.Menu />} />
</Badge>
```

### Filled or Outlined Styles

Define visual resonance with your design vision. Opt for a bold filled style or a subtle, outlined variant
using the [[isOutlined]] attribute.

```jsx
<Stack gap="2rem">
  <Badge content={10} tone="major" isOutlined>
    <Icon ele={<Icon.CopyAll />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="minor" isOutlined>
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Person />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="neutral" isOutlined>
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Phone />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={10} tone="info" isOutlined>
    <Icon ele={<Icon.FileUpload />} />

    <Icon ele={<Icon.Remove />} />
  </Badge>
</Stack>
```

### Numeric Limit and "+"

Add numeric content elegantly with the Badge. Specify a [[max]] value to gracefully accommodate varying data ranges.
When numbers surpass the limit, the Badge smartly incorporates a `+` sign for clarity without complexity.

```jsx
<Stack gap="2rem">
  <Badge content={300} max={200} tone="info">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Email />} />
  </Badge>
  <Badge content={110} tone="info">
    <Icon ele={<Icon.Email />} />
  </Badge>
</Stack>
```

### Blinking Animation

Enliven your app's interaction using the captivating [[isBlink]] attribute. Harness dynamic blinking animations
to create engaging live status indicators, adding an element of intrigue to user experiences.

```jsx
<Badge isDotted isBlink tone="success">
  <Icon ele={<Icon.Person />} />
</Badge>
```
