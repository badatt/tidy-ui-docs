# Container Component Documentation

Welcome to the world of the `Container` component ‚Äì your ultimate master layout wrapper that's designed to adapt and cater to different screen widths and breakpoints. With its dynamic capabilities, the `Container` effortlessly orchestrates the layout of components, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing user experience.

## Introduction

The `Container` component acts as the central hub of your layout, enveloping and organizing your content. Its ability to respond to various screen widths and breakpoints makes it an indispensable tool for crafting flexible and adaptable user interfaces.

## Fluid and Fixed Layouts

The `Container` component offers two main layout options:

### Fluid Container

The fluid layout is your go-to choice for a smooth and continuous viewing experience. As the screen width changes, the `Container` adjusts its width accordingly, ensuring that your content flows fluidly and harmoniously within its boundaries.

### Fixed Container

The fixed layout, on the other hand, provides a more structured approach. The `Container` breaks at each screen breakpoint, allowing the underlying components to align precisely at these designated points. This creates a visually appealing composition, ensuring that your content is presented in a well-defined and organized manner.

## Maximum Width and Gutters

With the `Container` component, you're in control of the finer details:

- **Maximum Width**: You have the option to set a fixed maximum width for your `Container`, ensuring that your layout maintains a specific width regardless of screen changes. This can help you achieve a consistent and controlled design.

- **Gutters**: You can choose to omit gutters, effectively utilizing the entire screen width. This can be particularly useful when you want your content to span the entire available area without any padding or spacing.

## Theming and Styling Integration

Like a chameleon, the `Container` component effortlessly blends into your design system thanks to its integration with theming and styling. This ensures that your layout maintains a consistent and appealing look, seamlessly aligning with your application's visual identity.

## Conclusion

The `Container` component is your ally in creating dynamic, responsive, and visually pleasing layouts. Its fluid and fixed layout options, coupled with the ability to set maximum width and control gutters, provide a powerful toolkit for crafting user interfaces that shine.
