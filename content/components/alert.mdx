## Key Features

### Classification-Based

To specify the type of information you want to convey through an alert, you can use different levels like `info` for updates,
`success` for indicating successful actions, `warning` for providing cautionary messages, and `danger`
to highlight critical events. This can be achieved by adjusting the [[status]] attribute of the alert component.

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
  <Alert status="info">
    Psst! Here's a fun fact: Butterflies taste with their feet. ðŸ¦‹ðŸ‘£ Just thought you should know!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success">High-five! ðŸ™Œ You just leveled up in the game of life. Keep rocking!</Alert>
  <Alert status="warning">Caution: Life's a roller coaster. Secure your snacks and emotions!</Alert>
  <Alert status="danger">404 Error: Brain not found. Please try again after caffeine.</Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Actionable

By using the **AlertTitle**, message content, and **AlertFooter** components, you can create alerts with
richer descriptions. The **AlertTitle** allows you to emphasize the context of the alert,
while the message content section lets you offer additional details. In the **AlertFooter**,
you can prompt users for actions or provide extra information. The layout of these components can
be customized according to your preferences, providing flexibility in design.

```jsx
<Alert ele={<FlexBox fld="column" />} status="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <Text.h6>Your action needed!</Text.h6>
  </AlertTitle>
  ðŸ”” Hey there! Just a heads-up: Your inbox is feeling lonely. Give it some love and check for new messages. Happy
  communicating!
  <AlertFooter>
    <ButtonCluster isStretched>
      <Button variant="simple" tone="danger">
        Next time
      </Button>
      <Button tone="major">Go to inbox</Button>
    </ButtonCluster>
  </AlertFooter>
</Alert>
```

### Informational

You have the ability to capture users' attention effectively by utilizing solid alerts.
To make alerts stand out even more prominently, you can employ the [[isFilled]] attribute,
which renders alert messages with a solid and attention-grabbing appearance.

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
  <Alert status="info" isFilled>
    Psst! Here's a fun fact: Butterflies taste with their feet. ðŸ¦‹ðŸ‘£ Just thought you should know!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success" isFilled>
    High-five! ðŸ™Œ You just leveled up in the game of life. Keep rocking!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning" isFilled>
    Caution: Life's a roller coaster. Secure your snacks and emotions!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="danger" isFilled>
    404 Error: Brain not found. Please try again after caffeine.
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Rounded or Sharp-Edged

You have the option to personalize the style of filled alerts to have sharp edges. By utilizing the [[isSharp]]
attribute, you can achieve this look. This setting is useful when you want the alerts
to match the design of your website, whether it's solid and sharp-edged or more rounded in appearance.

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
  <Alert status="info" isFilled isSharp>
    Psst! Here's a fun fact: Butterflies taste with their feet. ðŸ¦‹ðŸ‘£ Just thought you should know!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success" isFilled isSharp>
    High-five! ðŸ™Œ You just leveled up in the game of life. Keep rocking!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning" isFilled isSharp>
    Caution: Life's a roller coaster. Secure your snacks and emotions!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="danger" isFilled isSharp>
    404 Error: Brain not found. Please try again after caffeine.
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```
