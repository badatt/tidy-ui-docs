## Import

Tidy UI exports 3 alert related components.

- `Alert` : The wrapper for alert components, which can be used standalone for solid alerts.
- `AlertTitle` : The title of the alert that signifies its severity.
- `AlertFooter` : Footer to have any actions, notes etc.

```js
import { Alert, AlertFooter, AlertTitle } from '@tidy-ui/alert';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Alert>Simple alert</Alert>
```

### Status

Change the status of the alerts by passing the `status` prop. This affects the
color scheme and icon used. Alert supports `error`, `success`, `warning`, and
`info` statuses.

```jsx
<Alert ele={<FlexBox fld="column" />} status="success">
  <AlertTitle>
    <Text.h6 tone="success">success</Text.h6>
  </AlertTitle>
  Lorem Ipsum dolor
  <AlertFooter>
    <ButtonCluster isStretched>
      <Button variant="simple" tone="neutral">
        Cancel
      </Button>
      <Button tone="success">Ok</Button>
    </ButtonCluster>
  </AlertFooter>
</Alert>
```

### Variant

`Alert` has 4 variant styles you can use. Pass the `variant` prop and use either
`subtle`, `solid`, `left-accent` or `top-accent`.

```jsx
<Alert>Simple alert</Alert>
```

### Composition

`Alert` ships with smaller components to allow for flexibility in creating all
kinds of layouts. Here's an example of a custom alert style and layout:

```jsx
<Alert>Simple alert</Alert>
```

`Alert` can also incorporate other Chakra components. Here's an example of an
alert with wrapping description text and the `CloseButton` component with simple
close functionality:

```jsx
<Alert>Simple alert</Alert>
```
