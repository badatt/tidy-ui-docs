## Overview

The Alert component is your tool for delivering clear and impactful messages to your users.
It's like having your own personal messenger that knows how to grab attention. With the Alert component, you can:

- Display alerts based on information classification: info, success, warning, or danger.
- Create two types of alerts: actionable and informational.
- Craft actionable alerts with titles, content, and footers for buttons.
- Highlight classification with solid bars for informational alerts.
- Choose between sharp-edged or rounded alert styles.

Tidy UI is excited to offer you a trio of alert-related components that are here to make your interface shine!

**Alert** : Think of this as the main hub for alerting your users. It's like a super versatile wrapper that holds different types of alerts,
and it can even stand alone as a solid alert. So whether you're telling them something important or just giving them a heads-up, the Alert's got your back!

**AlertTitle** : This is like the spokesperson for the alert. It's in charge of showing how serious or important the alert is.
It's like the headline that gives you a quick idea of what's going on.

**AlertFooter** : Imagine this as the helper down at the bottom of the alert. It's there to assist with any extra things you want to share.
Need to add actions or notes? The AlertFooter's the place to do it. It's like the friendly neighbor that's always willing to lend a hand.

## Key Features

### Classification-Based

Whether you've got exciting updates `info`, triumphant victories `success`, cautionary tales `warning`, or serious matters `danger`,
you can fit each message into the perfect box. Just tell the component which vibe you want with the <mark>status</mark> attribute, and voila - you've
got a personalized alert that speaks your language!

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
  <Alert status="info">
    Psst! Here's a fun fact: Butterflies taste with their feet. ðŸ¦‹ðŸ‘£ Just thought you should know!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success">High-five! ðŸ™Œ You just leveled up in the game of life. Keep rocking!</Alert>
  <Alert status="warning">Caution: Life's a roller coaster. Secure your snacks and emotions!</Alert>
  <Alert status="danger">404 Error: Brain not found. Please try again after caffeine.</Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Actionable

Get ready to create alerts that spark action! With the **AlertTitle**, message content, and **AlertFooter** combo, you've got the ultimate trio.
Make your title pop, share the important stuff in the message, and hey, why not throw in some action buttons too?
It's like your alert's very own stage. And guess what? You're the director, customizing the layout just the way you like it!

```jsx
<Alert ele={<FlexBox fld="column" />} status="info">
  <AlertTitle>
    <Text.h6>Your action needed!</Text.h6>
  </AlertTitle>
  ðŸ”” Hey there! Just a heads-up: Your inbox is feeling lonely. Give it some love and check for new messages. Happy communicating!
  <AlertFooter>
    <ButtonCluster isStretched>
      <Button variant="simple" tone="danger">
        Next time
      </Button>
      <Button tone="major">Go to inbox</Button>
    </ButtonCluster>
  </AlertFooter>
</Alert>
```

### Informational

Time to let your messages shine! Grab the spotlight with informational alerts. These sturdy bars are like the VIP section for your important news -
they make sure nobody misses out. And the best part? You're in control! Just flip the switch by using the <mark>isFilled</mark> property, and watch your message take center stage.

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
  <Alert status="info" isFilled>
    Psst! Here's a fun fact: Butterflies taste with their feet. ðŸ¦‹ðŸ‘£ Just thought you should know!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="success" isFilled>
    High-five! ðŸ™Œ You just leveled up in the game of life. Keep rocking!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning" isFilled>
    Caution: Life's a roller coaster. Secure your snacks and emotions!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="danger" isFilled>
    404 Error: Brain not found. Please try again after caffeine.
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Rounded or Sharp-Edged

You're in charge of the alert's fashion show! Whether you're into sleek edges or cozy curves, you've got the power to make it your own.
Just snap your fingers (or set the <mark>isSharp</mark> property), and watch your alert transform into the style icon you've always dreamed of. Walk that runway, designer! ðŸŽ‰

```jsx
<Stack order="column" gap="1rem">
