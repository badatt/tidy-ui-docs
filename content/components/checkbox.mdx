# Checkboxes Component Documentation

The **Checkboxes** component serves as an interactive user interface element designed to capture binary responses. It is particularly useful when you need to obtain "yes" or "no" answers from users. By offering customizable appearance and behavior options, this component ensures a seamless integration into your application's user interface.

## Key Features

- **Binary Responses:** The primary purpose of the **Checkboxes** component is to gather binary responses from users. When a user checks the checkbox, it signifies a "yes" response, and leaving it unchecked indicates a "no" response.

- **Customizable Size:** You have the freedom to determine the size of the checkbox based on your design preferences and user interface requirements. Choose from options like small, medium, large, and extra-large.

- **Visual Variants:** The component offers two distinct visual variants for the checkboxes:

  - **Filled Variant:** When selected (checked), a distinctive tick mark is prominently displayed within the checkbox.
  - **Outlined Variant:** The checkbox remains outlined, with a tick mark appearing inside when selected.

- **Intermediate State:** In scenarios where you need to indicate an intermediate state of response, such as "partially agreed" or "in progress," the **Checkboxes** component accommodates this requirement. When in the intermediate state, a subtle line is added inside the checkbox.

- **Dynamic Status Indication:** Depending on the status of the emitted information, you can assign a relevant status to the checkbox. This dynamic status allows you to visually represent the current state of the checkbox, such as success, error, or a neutral state.

- **Theming and Styling:** The **Checkboxes** component is designed to seamlessly integrate with your application's theming and styling. You can effortlessly align the component's appearance with your overall design scheme.
