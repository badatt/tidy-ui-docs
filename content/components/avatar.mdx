## Key Features

### User Representation

The Avatar component offers a simple yet powerful way to represent users visually within your application.
It provides flexibility through various configurations:

#### Using Source

You can enhance the Avatar's appearance by setting a source [[src]], which displays a user's profile image
within a visually appealing circular frame.

#### Fallback to Initials

In case no source is available, you have the option to set a [[name]]. The Avatar will then generate initials from
the user's full name and display them neatly within the circular frame.

#### Icon Integration

For instances when neither source nor name is provided, the Avatar can still shine by rendering a specified
[[icon]] inside the circular frame. This ensures a consistent and meaningful representation even without specific user details.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/64/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar name="Isaac Newton" />
  <Avatar icon={<Icon.RotatingCircle />} />
</Stack>
```

### Handy Backup

When you encounter a situation where user details are unavailable and no custom icon is specified, the Avatar
component gracefully defaults to displaying a universally recognizable person icon. This ensures that your application
maintains a consistent and visually pleasing user representation even when specific information is absent.

```jsx
<Avatar />
```

### Finding the Right Fit

The Avatar component provides the flexibility to set different sizes according to your needs. By utilizing the [[girth]] property,
you can choose from a range of options, including double-extra-small to double-extra-large. This variety ensures that
the Avatar harmonizes seamlessly with your overall design aesthetic and user interface requirements.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Avatar girth="xxs" src="https://picsum.photos/id/823/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="xs" src="https://picsum.photos/id/832/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="sm" src="https://picsum.photos/id/836/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="md" src="https://picsum.photos/id/978/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="lg" src="https://picsum.photos/id/996/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="xl" src="https://picsum.photos/id/1027/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar girth="xxl" src="https://picsum.photos/id/1074/200/200.webp" />
</Stack>
```

### Social Media Vibe

Elevating user representation becomes effortless with the Avatar component's versatile features.
Here's how you can enhance its visual impact:

#### Accent for Extra Information

Adding an accent to the Avatar creates a visually appealing circular border. This border can be utilized
to convey supplementary information, contributing to a more informative user interface.

#### AvatarBadge for Added Detail

The AvatarBadge feature lets you go a step further by including a dot on the Avatar. This subtle yet
effective addition can be used to signify user actions, notifications, or other meaningful cues.

#### Tone for User Status

For an extra layer of information, you can set a tone for the AvatarBadge. This enables you to communicate
valuable user status details such as online, offline, or other relevant indicators.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Avatar accent="rgb(22, 162, 73)" src="https://picsum.photos/id/646/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/659/200/200.webp">
    <AvatarBadge tone="rgb(245, 159, 10)"/>
  </AvatarBadge>
</Stack>
```

### Group Them Up

This feature allows you to stack numerous Avatars in a visually pleasing arrangement, maintaining a cohesive user
representation. With the ability to set the [[max]] attribute, you have control over the number of Avatars displayed
within the group, ensuring an organized and streamlined user interface.

```jsx
<AvatarGroup max={8}>
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/64/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/433/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/646/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/659/200/200.webp" />
  <Avatar src="https://picsum.photos/id/660/200/200.webp" />
